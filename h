(The little wooden man remains perfectly still, as if considering your request. Then, with a voice as calm and steady as before, he speaks again—this time, the story shifting, reshaping itself like wood being carved anew.)

"You want the truth? The full truth? Fine. Listen well."

(He tilts his head slightly, his wooden joints creaking ever so faintly.)

"I killed the burglar."

(The words land heavy in the air, final and absolute.)

"He thought he was clever, slipping into Mr. Porter’s house in the dead of night. Thought no one would see him. But I saw him. Just as I always do."

(A pause—so small, yet the silence stretches.)

"He saw me, too. Just standing there. In the corner. Unmoving. Watching. And something in him broke."

"You see, there’s something about me... something that lingers. Something you feel, even if you don’t understand it. He felt it. That cold shiver up his spine. That tightening in his chest. He wanted to look away, but he couldn’t."

"And that’s when panic took him."

(The wooden man does not move, but somehow, his presence feels closer now.)

"He turned too fast. His foot caught on the rug—an old thing, curled at the edges. He lost his balance, stumbled back, arms flailing. And then... then came the window."

(A pause, just long enough for the image to settle.)

"The glass shattered like ice, spraying into the night as he fell. A moment of weightlessness. A scream—short, sharp, then gone. And then the ground met him."

(The silence now is absolute.)

"I didn’t move. I didn’t touch him. I just was."

"And that was enough."

(The little wooden man stands still, hands in his pockets, unblinking. As if he has always been standing there. As if he always will be.)

"Now tell me... do you still want to know the truth?"








You said:

(The little wooden man remains still, his carved face unreadable. Yet, something about him—something in the way he lingers, in the space he takes up—feels heavier now, like the weight of a story unfinished.)

"Ah... You’re thinking about the blood, aren’t you?" (His voice is calm, almost thoughtful.) "You’re wondering if it really happened the way I said. If a fall like that—through glass, from that height—would leave as much blood as you imagined."

(A pause. Then, quieter—)

"You’re right. There wasn’t much blood at all."

(The room seems colder now, the memory of broken glass and distant pavement settling between the words.)

"The cut on his head was deep, yes, but the real damage? It was inside. The way he landed. The angle. The way his neck twisted when he hit the ground. That’s what ended it. Quick. Final."

(A longer pause now, heavier, like the moment itself is asking if you truly want to continue.)

"Blood washes away. It soaks into the ground. But the feeling? The way the air changed that night? That never leaves."

(The little wooden man’s gaze—though unchanging, unmoving—seems to settle more firmly now, as if measuring something in you.)

"You’re asking all the right questions. But are you sure you’re ready for the rest?"







You said:
yes.

(The little wooden man does not move. He does not blink. But something about him feels... deeper now, as if the stillness is just a surface, and beneath it lies something vast, something waiting.)

"Alright." (His voice is softer now, but steady, unwavering.) "You’ve come this far. You deserve the rest."

(The silence stretches, the weight of the moment pressing in.)

"The fall killed him. Not the blood, not the glass—just the way he landed. And that should’ve been the end of it. Should’ve been just another tragedy in the dark, another unlucky fool who made a wrong move at the wrong time."

(A pause. The air tightens.)

"But it wasn’t."

(Something shifts—not in the wooden man himself, but in the space around him. A whisper of something unseen, something just beyond reach.)

"Because when Mr. Porter found him—when he looked down from the broken window, saw the stillness of that body, the absence of breath—he didn’t look surprised. He didn’t call for help. He just... stood there. Watching."

(The wooden man’s voice lowers, like a secret being passed through time.)

"Like he knew it was going to happen."

(A pause, long and deliberate.)

"And then, slowly, his gaze lifted. Past the body. Past the broken glass. Up. To the window."

(Another pause—long enough to make your heart beat just a little harder.)

"To me."

(The silence that follows is heavy, expectant. The little wooden man does not move. He does not explain. He simply waits.)

"Now tell me... do you still want the truth?"







You said:
yes.

(The little wooden man remains still, hands in his pockets. The room feels different now—colder, heavier. As if something unseen lingers just beyond the edges of perception. And yet, his voice, when it comes, is as calm as ever.)

"Then listen."

(A pause, stretching just long enough to make you feel the weight of what’s coming.)

"Mr. Porter saw the body. He saw the shattered glass. And then he saw me."

(The little wooden man tilts his head ever so slightly—not enough to be real movement, but enough to feel like it.)

"And do you know what he did?"

(Another pause. The air is thick with anticipation.)

"He smiled."

(The word hangs in the air, unnatural in its quiet certainty.)

"Not a big smile. Not one of joy. Just the smallest curl at the corner of his mouth. Like a man seeing something he expected all along."

(The room is silent. The wooden figure stands, unchanged, but something about him feels closer now.)

"He turned away after that. Didn’t speak of it again. Didn’t answer questions. Didn’t try to explain. Because deep down, he knew... just like you do now."

(Another pause, as if waiting for the realization to settle in.)

"I didn’t move. I didn’t touch him. I didn’t trip him. But I was there."

(The little wooden man remains as he always has—hands in pockets, watching, waiting. And in the stillness, something unspoken lingers in the air. A question. A whisper.)

"Now tell me… was it really me who killed him?"







You said:
are you sure

(The little wooden man stands there, hands in his pockets, as still as ever. The air around him feels thick, heavy, as if the space itself is holding something unseen. His voice, when it comes, is quiet—but there is something absolute in it.)

"Am I sure?"

(A pause. Longer this time. More deliberate.)

"Are you?"

(The room seems smaller now. The shadows longer. The silence pressing in.)

"I told you what happened. I told you what he saw. But certainty… that’s a funny thing, isn’t it?"

(Another pause. The wooden figure does not move, but somehow, the air seems to shift around him.)

"I was there. I have always been there. I have never moved. And yet…"

(A beat. A flicker of something just beyond understanding.)

"He died, didn’t he?"

(The silence that follows is suffocating. The little wooden man does not blink, does not breathe. He only waits.)

"So tell me…"

(A whisper now, just on the edge of hearing.)

"Are you sure?"







You said:
yes.#

(The little wooden man does not move. He does not react. But somehow, the space around him seems to shift—like the weight of something unseen settling into place.)

"Good."

(His voice is calm, steady. As if the answer was never really in question.)

"You wanted the truth. And now you have it."

(A long pause. The wooden figure remains as he always has—hands in pockets, still, watching.)

"But the truth… it stays with you. It lingers. It changes things."

(The air feels colder now, heavier. As if something has shifted, something that cannot be undone.)

"And now that you know…"

(The silence that follows is deep, almost alive.)

"You’ll never stop wondering, will you?"

(The wooden man does not move. He does not need to. Because the answer is already there. Hanging in the air. Pressing against the walls. Settling in the corners of your mind, where it will remain. Watching. Waiting.)

(Just like him.)
